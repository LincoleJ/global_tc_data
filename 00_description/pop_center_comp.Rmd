Per US Census Bureau, the center of population is the point whose latitude $(\bar{\phi})$ and longitude $(\bar{\lambda})$ that satisfy the equations:

$$
\bar{\phi} = \dfrac{\sum w_i\phi_i}{\sum w_i} \;\;\;\; \bar{\lambda} = \dfrac{\sum w_i\lambda_i\cos(\phi_i \dfrac{\pi}{180})}{\sum w_i \cos(\phi_i(\dfrac{\pi}{180}))}
$$

where $\phi_i, \lambda_i,$ and $w_i$ are the latitude, longitude, and populuation attached to the basic small units of area used in the computation. 

Is it fine just to compute

$$
\bar{\phi} = \dfrac{\sum w_i\phi_i}{\sum w_i} \;\;\;\; \bar{\lambda} = \dfrac{\sum w_i \lambda_i}{\sum w_i}
$$
Let $\phi_i, \lambda_i,$ $w_i$, be the latitude, longitude, and \textit{weighted} population in each 1-km grid cell, compute 
$$
\bar{\phi} = \dfrac{\sum w_i\phi_i}{\sum w_i} \;\;\;\; \bar{\lambda} = \dfrac{\sum w_i \lambda_i}{\sum w_i}
$$
as population center points for that particular ADM2.

In particular, each $w_i$ is computed as 

$$
w_i = \gamma_i \cdot \text{population}
$$

where $\gamma_i$ is the percentage of coverage of the ADM2 in that grid cell
